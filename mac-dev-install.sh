‚ö†Ô∏è  This script will prepare development environment on your computer.
According to your development needs, you can choose which software packages
will be installed.

$BOLD   Common packages: $RESET
- package_init      (Apple XCode, Homebrew, Git and Python PIP)
- package_java      (Open JDK, Maven, Tomcat, IntelliJ IDEA CE)
- package_js        (NodeJS, IntelliJ IDEA CE)
- package_python    (Python, PyCharm CE, Jupyter Lab)
- package_ide       (IntelliJ, VS Code, Eclipse, Atom, Brackets)
- package_browsers  (Chrome, Canary, Chromium, Edge, Firefox, Opera)
- package_messengers        (WhatsApp, Telegram, Viber, Zoom)
- package_qa                (Open JDK, Postman, JMerer, Selenium)

$BOLD   Team specific packages: $RESET
- package_devops    (gh, groovy, docker, kubectl, cf-cli, vault)
- package_neo       (Open JDK 8, NodeJS 14)

$BOLD   Custom package: $RESET
- package_custom    (This is just template for custom package creation)

$BOLD   Upgrade package: $RESET
- package_upgrade (upgrade all installed packages to the latest versions)

The expected execution time may vary depending on the number of packages you
want to install. In most cases, it will take about 10-30 minutes,
if Apple XCode is already installed.
During the installation process, you will be asked to enter your iUser account
and will be prompted several times to enter your password and accept licenses,
if necessary.

üîì  $BOLD To install programs, you need administrator rights on your Mac.
On a private MacBook, make sure you're logged in with an administrator account.
On a corporate MacBook, click on the Privileges icon in the MacOS Dock to
request administrator rights, and make sure it turns yellow (open padlock).
