‚ö†Ô∏è  This script will prepare development environment on your computer.
According to your development needs, you can choose which software packages
will be installed.
Common tools:
- package_init (Apple XCode, Homebrew, Git and Python PIP)
- package_java (Open JDK, Maven, IntelliJ IDEA CE)
- package_python (Python, PyCharm CE, Jupyter Lab)
- package_js (NodeJS, IntelliJ IDEA CE)
- package_ide (IntelliJ IDEA CE, Visual Studio Code, Eclipse JEE)
- package_browsers (Chrome, Canary, Chromium, Edge, Firefox, Opera)
- package_messangers (WhatsUp, Telegram, Viber, Zoom, Slack)
- package_virtualization (Docker Desktop, Parallels Desktop)
- package_miscellaneous (Adobe Acrobat, Atom, Brackets, Mac Fan Control, Postman, Snagit, Unarchiver, VLC)
Team specific tools:
- package_devops (gh, groovy, vault, kubectl, iacbox, cf-cli, telnet, wget)
- package_neo (Open JDK 8, NodeJS 14)
Personal tools:
- package_personal (Google Drive, uTorrent, tree, mkdocs-material, aliases)

The expected execution time may vary depending on the number of packages you
wish to install. In most cases it will be 10 to 60 minutes if Apple XCode is
already installed.
During the installation process, you will be asked to enter your iUser account
and will be prompted several times to enter your password and accept licenses,
if necessary.\n
üîì  To install programs, you need administrator rights on your Mac. These permissions
are disabled by default. Before starting the process, click on the Privileges icon
in the MacOS Dock to request administrator privileges, and make sure it turns yellow
(open padlock).
